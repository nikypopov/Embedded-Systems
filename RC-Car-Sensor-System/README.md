### Abstract:

This project is a proof of concept for a dedicated sensor
system for an RC car. It utilizes 3 sensors, those being 2 I2S
microphones and an ultrasonic distance sensor, all connected to a
BeagleBone Black. The output for this model is simply 2 LEDs, 1
corresponding to each microphone. In a future model, this output
would be translated to the motors of the RC car using a connected
navigation system.
